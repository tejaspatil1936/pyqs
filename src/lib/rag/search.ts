 * Subject-scoped pgvector similarity search returning k DISTINCT questions.

 * Subject isolation is the WHERE clause on papers.standard_subject — SQL,
 * applied before vector ordering, never left to the LLM (see CLAUDE.md).
 *
 * The corpus contains many verbatim duplicates (the same exam uploaded
 * multiple times, and questions legitimately repeated across exams), so the
 * top-k is deduplicated on whitespace/case-normalized question_text — the
 * synthesis context gets k different questions, not one question k times.
 * DISTINCT ON forgoes the ANN index, but the subject filter bounds the scan
 * to a few thousand rows, which Postgres handles in milliseconds.
